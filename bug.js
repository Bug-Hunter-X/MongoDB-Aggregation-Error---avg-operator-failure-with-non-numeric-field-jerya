```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      age: {
        $gt: 25
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: {
        $avg: "$age"
      }
    }
  }
])
```
This aggregation pipeline first filters users with age greater than 25 and then groups them by city to calculate the average age of users within each city.  The issue is the potential for an error if the `age` field is not consistently a number.  If some entries have `age` as a string, the `$avg` operator will fail.
